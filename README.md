# SpeedCrunch
SpeedCrunch is a high-precision scientific calculator.
It features a syntax-highlighted scrollable display and is designed to be fully used via keyboard. Some distinctive
features are auto-completion of functions and variables, a formula book, and quick
insertion of constants from various fields of knowledge. It is available for Windows, macOS,
and Linux in a number of languages.

Visit the [SpeedCrunch website](https://www.speedcrunch.org/) for
[downloads](https://www.speedcrunch.org/download.html) and the
[online manual](https://www.speedcrunch.org/introduction.html).

## Building
To build SpeedCrunch, you need:

- A compiler toolchain with C17 and C++17 support
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) 6.x (Core, Widgets, Help, Network, Test)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.16 or later

To build SpeedCrunch in a dedicated build directory and install it, run the following
commands from the root of the source directory:

    cmake -S src -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
    cmake --install build --config Release

When building against a Qt version that is not the system default Qt installation,
point CMake towards the Qt installation to use by setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or
`Qt6_DIR` when running CMake.

Example (Homebrew on macOS):

    brew install qt
    cmake -S src -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt)"
    cmake --build build --config Release --parallel

You can customize the build using the following variables. These are specified when
running CMake, in the form `cmake -S src -B build -Dvariable=value`.

- **PORTABLE_SPEEDCRUNCH**: Set this to `on` to have the application settings stored
  in the same location as the executable, e.g. for running from a USB drive without
  requiring installation.
- **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX**: Change the installation prefix for SpeedCrunch.
- **HTML_DOCS_DIR**: Change the path to the HTML manual that's embedded in the binary
  by the build. By default, a bundled prebuilt copy is used to minimize dependencies.

## File locations
SpeedCrunch uses [Qt's standard per-user locations](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qstandardpaths.html)
for persistent application data and configuration:

| Platform | Application data | Preferences/configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/SpeedCrunch/` | `~/Library/Preferences/SpeedCrunch/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\SpeedCrunch\` | `%APPDATA%\SpeedCrunch\` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/SpeedCrunch/` (usually `~/.local/share/SpeedCrunch/`) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/SpeedCrunch/` (usually `~/.config/SpeedCrunch/`) |

Qt respects system-specific overrides to these locations. In the Windows portable build,
application data and preferences/configuration are all stored in the same directory as
the portable application.

## Building the manual
Building the HTML manual is normally not necessary because a prebuilt copy is included
with the SpeedCrunch source. For more information, see the [manual's README](doc/src/README.md).
